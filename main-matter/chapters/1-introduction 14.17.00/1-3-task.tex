The primary target of this thesis' project is to evaluate the paradigm of DataOps testing within a given use case. The previously described use case analytics solution has already been developed. This solution needs to be evaluated from a DataOps perspective, redesigning it to comply with state-of-the-art DataOps methodologies and standards. Then, the new solution needs to be enhanced with suitable testing frameworks, considering the use case circumstances and priorities. All required infrastructure for reaching the project targets needs to be realized and deployed within \ac{aws}, the Amazon cloud platform. Additionally, for scalability reasons, all analytical processes are desired to be designed in a server-less approach.
