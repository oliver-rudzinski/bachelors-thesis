The project is conducted within the \textit{Analytics} department of \textit{DXC Technology Company}. This division is currently implementing DataOps as a competence inside its service portfolio and is working on DataOps realization projects with several clients of different business areas. A proof of concept, outlining the features and advantages of DataOps, is desired. On the one hand, it can help to get potential customers interested in DataOps and DXC realizing it. On the other hand, such a project could also be used in existing client workshops and for employee education purposes. The latter could also improve the performance of current and future DataOps projects conducted by DXC Analytics.
