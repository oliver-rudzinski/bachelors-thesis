The latter is complex and time-consuming as it manages data with heterogeneous content and diverse quality problems. Ensuring data quality requires tracking quality defects along the ETL process. In this paper, we present the main ETL quality characteristics. We provide an overview of the existing ETL process data quality approaches. We also present a comparative study of some commercial ETL tools to show how much these tools consider data quality dimensions. To illustrate our study, we carry out experiments using an ETL dedicated solution (Talend Data Integration) and a data quality dedicated solution (Talend Data Quality). Based on our study, we identify and discuss quality challenges to be addressed in our future research.},

In contradiction to traditional data quality assurance methods, the proposed approach provides the usage of a domain specific language (DSL) for description data quality models. Data quality models consists of graphical diagrams, which elements contain requirements for data object's values and procedures for data object's analysis. The DSL interpreter makes the data quality model executable therefore ensuring measurement and improving of data quality. The described approach can be applied: (1) to check the completeness, accuracy and consistency of accumulated data; (2) to support data migration in cases when software architecture and/or data models are changed; (3) to gather data from different data sources and to transfer them to data warehouse.},

  abstract = {Human beings share their good or bad opinions about subjects, products, and services through internet and social networks. The ability to effectively analyze this kind of information is now seen as a key competitive advantage to better inform decisions. In order to do so, organizations employ Sentiment Analysis (SA) techniques on these data. However, the usage of social media around the world is ever-increasing, which considerably accelerates massive data generation and makes traditional SA systems unable to deliver useful insights. Such volume of data can be efficiently analyzed using the combination of SA techniques and Big Data technologies. In fact, big data is not a luxury but an essential necessary to make valuable predictions. However, there are some challenges associated with big data such as quality that could highly affect the SA systems’ accuracy that use huge volume of data. Thus, the quality aspect should be addressed in order to build reliable and credible systems. For this, the goal of our research work is to consider Big Data Quality Metrics (BDQM) in SA that rely of big data. In this paper, we first highlight the most eloquent BDQM that should be considered throughout the Big Data Value Chain (BDVC) in any big data project. Then, we measure the impact of BDQM on a novel SA method accuracy in a real case study by giving simulation results.},
