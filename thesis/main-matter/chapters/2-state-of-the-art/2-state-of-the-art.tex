The discipline of testing can be found throughout the entire scope of DataOps \cite[42]{Schmidt2019}. However, it does not provide specific testing measures or frameworks. This is because data analytics solutions are tailor-made based on the specific needs of their areas of application. Moreover, available DataOps testing foundations remain a set of guidelines and abstract requirements that need to be applied and customized individually within each DataOps solution.

In this chapter, general DataOps and testing foundations are deduced in order to understand the need for DataOps testing and aid the design process of a use-case-specific testing framework which is to follow in Chapter \ref{chap:testing-framework}.

All in all, these tests are expected to invoke the majority of outcome possibilities, leading to a high test coverage and correct performance validation \cite{DataKitchen2020a}.
