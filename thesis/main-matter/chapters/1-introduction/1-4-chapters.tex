This chapter, the \nameref{chap:introduction} chapter, presented the high-level issues of traditional analytics solution development and proposed DataOps as an enhancement.

Chapter \ref{chap:theoretical-backgrounds}, the \nameref{chap:theoretical-backgrounds} chapter, introduces DataOps and its key principles and methodologies as well as general testing frameworks for both software and data quality testing.

Chapter \ref{chap:actual-state-analysis}, the \nameref{chap:actual-state-analysis} chapter, describes the preexisting analytics solution for the given use case and states present issues which stand in contrast to the task definition.

Chapter \ref{chap:testing-framework}, the \nameref{chap:testing-framework} chapter, designs the method for implementing holistic DataOps testing inside the use case. It considers the findings from Chapters \ref{chap:theoretical-backgrounds} and \ref{chap:actual-state-analysis}.

Chapter \ref{chap:implementation}, the \nameref{chap:implementation} chapter, enables DataOps methodologies described in Chapter \ref{chap:theoretical-backgrounds} and implements the testing framework from Chapter \ref{chap:testing-framework}, taking missing aspects required by the project requirements into account.

Chapter \ref{chap:solution-evaluation}, the \nameref{chap:solution-evaluation} chapter, evaluates the new solution based on pre-defined criteria on the functional requirements of its DataOps and DataOps Testing capabilities.

Chapter \ref{chap:conclusion}, the final \nameref{chap:conclusion} chapter, summarizes all findings, proposes further research and enhancement, and concludes this thesis.
