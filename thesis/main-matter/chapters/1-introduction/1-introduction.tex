Data analytics has become a top-priority discipline for organizations of all industries. It is the crucial driver for several business use cases, including \ac{dwh} optimization, forecasting, customer and social analysis as well as fraud detection \cite{Statista}. Additionally, it is expected to aid the overall business decision-making process \cite{Souibgui2019}. Unfortunately, the development of such data analytics solutions remains complicated, and often, unsuccessful \cite{DataKitchen2019}.

This can be seen 87 percent of data science projects never reaching the state of production-grade solutions \cite{VentureBeat}. Moreover, Gartner reports that projects driven by \ac{ai} can mostly not be industrialized, resulting in bad scalability within the organizations \cite{White2019}. One reason for this might be that data analytics projects are still conducted in a non-dynamic and sequential way.

\textit{DataOps} is a new working model for conducting and maintaining data analytics projects, combining findings and best practices from manufacturing processes, \textit{DevOps} software development and \textit{agile} project management \cite[17\psqq]{Bergh2019}. Since data analytics solutions are data-driven software solutions, testing is an important factor of the entire DataOps development process \cite[40\psqq]{Bergh2019}. Testing is required to build up confidence and trust in the solution. This should not only prove that the solution is functional but that is also provides valuable and correct outcomes.

This bachelor's thesis deals with the topic of DataOps testing inside an exemplarily chosen Big Data \ac{bi} retail use case, specifically the \acf{mba}. Even though DataOps paves the path for testing by providing high-level testing ideologies, it does not specifically provide an actual testing framework. The project behind this thesis designs and implements a prototype DataOps testing framework and evaluates it within the given use case. The research goal of this thesis is to understand the area and process of DataOps testing, to find testing similarities and differences with DevOps, as well as to find technical limitations of DataOps testing.
